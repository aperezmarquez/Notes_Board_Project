*THIS IS A SMALL PROJECT USING REACT + VITE*

In this project I created a web that serves as a note board, where you can organize your work.

For this project I created a list of objects, which contains all the notes, every single item (note) added to this list can be modified or deleted. 
Whenever you add a new note/modify it/delete it, the web saves the list to cache, so if you reload the page all the notes are still there.
